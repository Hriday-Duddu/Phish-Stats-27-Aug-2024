Use Strong, Unique Passwords</p><p>Create a Complex Password: Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</p><p>Avoid Reusing Passwords: Never use the same password across multiple sites.</p><p>Use a Password Manager: Tools like LastPass or 1Password can generate and store complex passwords for you.</p><p>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</p><p>Set Up 2FA on Coinbase: Go to your Coinbase account settings and enable 2FA. You can use apps like Google Authenticator or Authy for generating the 2FA codes.</p><p>Use SMS as a Backup: Although less secure than an authenticator app, SMS 2FA is better than nothing.</p><p>3.

Keep Your Email Secure</p><p>Use a Secure Email Provider: Choose a reputable provider with strong security measures.</p><p>Enable 2FA on Your Email: Securing your email is vital since it’s often the recovery method for your other accounts.</p><p>5. Be Wary of Phishing Attacks</p><p>Verify URLs: Always check the URL before entering your login details. Ensure it’s the official Coinbase site.</p><p>Avoid Clicking on Links in Emails: Instead, manually type the website’s URL into your browser.</p><p>Use Anti-Phishing Tools: Consider browser extensions or security software that alerts you to potential phishing sites.</p><p>6. Keep Your Devices Secure</p><p>Update Software Regularly: Ensure your operating system, browser, and antivirus software are up to date.</p><p>Use Antivirus Software: Protect your devices from malware and keyloggers.</p><p>Avoid Public Wi-Fi: If you must use public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your connection.</p><p>7.
